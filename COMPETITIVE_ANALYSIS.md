## Conclusion

**The Opportunity:** Become the "Figma for Business Charts" - specializing in funnel visualizations with interactive embeds that work everywhere.

**The Market:** Large enough for both products to succeed in their respective niches. ChartPlugin = designers. Find&Tell = business teams.

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix online presence (SEO, content, social proof)
2. Build interactive embed feature
3. Create business template library
4. Launch content marketing
5. Target marketing/sales teams specifically
